As part of the Udemy course "The Complete Data Analytics Course!" https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-analyst-course-complete-data-analyst-bootcamp/  
I performed data cleaning using the dataset "Absenteeism".

Key steps included: 
✅ Processing categorical data by grouping 28 reasons for absence into four logical clusters using dummy variables. 
✅ Converting date columns into useful functions such as months and days of the week. 
✅ Reengineering functions such as education to simplify future modeling.
